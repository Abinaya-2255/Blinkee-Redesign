# BlINKEE-REDESIGN

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

DOMAIN: UI/UX DESIGN

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELS SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION: THIS TASK FOCUSES ON REDESIGNING THE HOMEPAGE OF BLINKKEE.COM, A SITE THAT SELLS GLOWING AND LED-BASED PRODUCTS. THE ORIGINAL INTERFACE LOOKED OUTDATED, CLUTTERED, AND VISUALLY INCONSISTENT. MY GOAL WAS TO TRANSFORM IT INTO A MODERN, ELEGANT, AND EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING EXPERIENCE WHILE KEEPING THE BRAND’S PURPOSE CLEAR.

THE BEFORE DESIGN HAD MULTIPLE USABILITY AND VISUAL ISSUES. THE HERO SECTION WAS CROWDED, THE NAVIGATION LOOKED HEAVY, AND THE BRANDING DIDN’T FEEL STRONG. THERE WAS NO CLEAR VISUAL HIERARCHY, NO FOCUSED MESSAGE, AND NO EMOTIONAL CONNECTION. IT FUNCTIONED AS A BASIC E-COMMERCE PAGE BUT DIDN’T STAND OUT OR SUPPORT A MEMORABLE FIRST IMPRESSION.

I STARTED BY CLEANING UP THE STRUCTURE. THE AFTER DESIGN IS BUILT AROUND CLARITY, SPACING, AND A STRONG ATMOSPHERE. THE NAVIGATION BAR IS MORE REFINED, THE LOGO SITS CLEANLY, AND THE MENU ELEMENTS ARE BALANCED. THE SEARCH BAR IS SIMPLIFIED TO MATCH THE MODERN LOOK OF THE HEADER.

THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS THE HERO SECTION. INSTEAD OF A BUSY, DISTRACTING IMAGE, I CHOSE A MINIMAL, CINEMATIC SCENE WITH A GLOWING ORB. THIS DIRECTLY CONNECTS TO BLINKKEE’S CORE — PRODUCTS THAT LIGHT UP AND CREATE VISUAL IMPACT. THE NEW HERO FEELS CALM, PREMIUM, AND MYSTERIOUS, SHIFTING THE BRAND TOWARD A MORE ELEVATED AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE.

THE MAIN HEADLINE WAS UPDATED TO CARRY MEANING: “BLINKKEE WHISPERS — WHERE LIGHT SPEAKS GENTLY.” THIS GIVES THE BRAND A VOICE AND SETS A MOOD, MAKING THE PAGE FEEL MORE INTENTIONAL. A SIMPLE CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTON SUPPORTS THIS WITHOUT CLUTTERING THE SPACE.

I ALSO ADDED QUICK-INFO ELEMENTS LIKE FREE SHIPPING AND MONEY-BACK GUARANTEES TO BUILD TRUST AND MATCH MODERN UI EXPECTATIONS.

COLOR CHOICES WERE STRATEGIC. DEEP MIDNIGHT BLUES AND SOFT WHITES BUILD A PREMIUM VISUAL MOOD AND MAKE THE GLOWING ELEMENTS STAND OUT. TYPOGRAPHY WAS REFINED FOR BETTER READABILITY AND BALANCE.

OVERALL, THE REDESIGN TRANSFORMS A BASIC, OUTDATED HOMEPAGE INTO A CLEAN, MODERN, AND BRAND-ALIGNED EXPERIENCE. IT IMPROVES NAVIGATION, CREATES A STRONG VISUAL HIERARCHY, AND MAKES THE BRAND FEEL MORE PREMIUM AND EMOTIONALLY APPEALING.

THIS TASK SHOWS MY APPROACH TO UI DESIGN: IDENTIFY THE WEAK POINTS, REDUCE CLUTTER, BUILD A CLEAR VISUAL FLOW, AND DELIVER A PAGE THAT FEELS FRESH, PURPOSEFUL, AND CONNECTED TO THE BRAND’S IDENTITY.
